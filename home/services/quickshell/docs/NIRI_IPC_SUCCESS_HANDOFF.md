# Lumin Bar - Niri IPC Integration SUCCESS - Handoff Document

## üéâ PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE SUCCESS!

**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Achievement:** Full niri IPC integration with real-time updates  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Workspace indicators and window counters working perfectly!

## üöÄ What We Accomplished

### Major Breakthrough: Complete Niri IPC Integration
- ‚úÖ **Real-time workspace indicators** - Update immediately when switching workspaces
- ‚úÖ **Live window counter** - Shows correct window count and updates in real-time  
- ‚úÖ **Persistent event stream** - Continuous connection for live updates
- ‚úÖ **Sequential refresh processing** - Fixed the core issue preventing workspace updates
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling** - Graceful connection management and recovery

### Technical Achievements
1. **Built custom niri IPC system** - No native Quickshell.Niri module exists
2. **Implemented proper socket communication** - Using Quickshell.Io Socket + Process hybrid
3. **Created event streaming architecture** - Real-time events trigger data refreshes
4. **Fixed QML structure issues** - Converted from Item to QtObject for proper Process handling
5. **Solved sequential processing** - Queue system prevents overlapping refresh requests

## üîß Final Architecture

### Core Components
```
/etc/nixos/home/services/quickshell/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/NiriIPC.qml          # ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Main IPC service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shell.qml                     # ‚úÖ Working UI with real-time updates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default.nix                   # ‚úÖ Home-manager integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other components...]         # Ready for expansion
```

### NiriIPC.qml - The Heart of the System
**Structure:** QtObject-based singleton with property-based child objects
- **Socket connection** for event stream (persistent)
- **Process-based queries** for data refresh (sequential)
- **Smart refresh batching** with queue processing
- **Automatic reconnection** and error recovery

### Key Technical Solutions

#### 1. Socket vs Process Hybrid Approach
```qml
// Event stream - persistent socket connection
Socket { /* Stays connected for events */ }

// Data queries - separate niri msg processes  
Process { /* One-shot queries, sequential processing */ }
```

#### 2. Sequential Refresh Queue (THE BREAKTHROUGH!)
```qml
// Problem: Multiple simultaneous Process calls failed
// Solution: Queue system with sequential processing
onTriggered: {
    const query = pendingQueries.shift()  // Process one at a time
    executeRefreshQuery(query, command)
}

onExited: {
    // Process next in queue after completion
    if (refreshTimer.pendingQueries.length > 0) {
        refreshTimer.start()
    }
}
```

#### 3. Response Format Conversion
```qml
// niri msg returns raw arrays: [workspace1, workspace2...]
// Socket returns wrapped: {"Ok": {"Workspaces": [...]}}
// Solution: Convert raw responses to socket format for consistency
```

## üéØ Current Functionality

### Workspace Management ‚úÖ
- **Real-time workspace indicators** - Shows all workspaces with proper styling
- **Active/focused state display** - Visual distinction for current workspace
- **Click to switch** - Workspace switching via UI clicks
- **Live updates** - Immediate updates when switching via keybinds

### Window Management ‚úÖ  
- **Live window counter** - Shows current window count
- **Real-time updates** - Updates when windows open/close/move
- **Focus tracking** - Knows which window is focused

### Event System ‚úÖ
- **Persistent event stream** - Continuous niri event monitoring
- **Smart refresh batching** - Prevents redundant queries
- **Comprehensive event handling** - All major niri events supported:
  - WorkspacesChanged, WorkspaceActivated
  - WindowsChanged, WindowFocusChanged
  - WindowOpenedOrChanged, WindowClosed
  - WorkspaceActiveWindowChanged

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Critical Fixes Made
1. **QML Structure** - Changed Item to QtObject to fix Process property assignments
2. **Response Parsing** - Fixed double JSON encoding and response format issues  
3. **Event Stream Management** - Separated persistent connections from one-shot queries
4. **Sequential Processing** - THE KEY FIX - Process objects can only handle one query at a time
5. **Command Format** - Fixed `focused-window` vs `focusedwindow` command naming

### Debug Process
- Used `qmllint` for syntax validation
- Added comprehensive logging for all IPC operations
- Traced event flow from niri ‚Üí socket ‚Üí parser ‚Üí UI
- Identified Process limitation through exit code analysis

## üöÄ Next Steps & Expansion Opportunities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Ready to implement)
1. **Enhanced System Monitoring**
   - CPU, memory, network stats
   - Battery status (MacBook only)
   - Audio/volume controls

2. **Visual Improvements**
   - Workspace animations and transitions
   - Window preview thumbnails
   - Custom Material 3 theming

3. **Feature Integration**
   - Application launcher integration
   - Notification system
   - OSD (On-Screen Display) integration

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish
1. **Optimization**
   - Reduce IPC overhead
   - Implement intelligent caching
   - Memory usage optimization

2. **Multi-Monitor Support**
   - Per-monitor workspace management
   - Independent bars per screen
   - Cross-monitor drag & drop

## üîß Development Environment

### Key Commands
```bash
# Test the bar
quickshell -c lumin

# Rebuild after changes
sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# Debug niri IPC manually
niri msg --json workspaces
niri msg --json event-stream

# Lint QML files
qmllint services/NiriIPC.qml
```

### Important Paths
- **Main config:** `/etc/nixos/home/services/quickshell/`
- **Shell entry:** `shell.qml`
- **IPC service:** `services/NiriIPC.qml`
- **Nix integration:** `default.nix`

## üìã Technical Notes

### Niri IPC Protocol Understanding
- **Single queries:** Connection closes after response (normal behavior)
- **Event stream:** Persistent connection, continuous events
- **Command format:** `niri msg --json <command>` (lowercase, dash-separated)
- **Response wrapping:** Socket responses wrapped in `{"Ok": {...}}`, Process responses are raw

### QuickShell Limitations Discovered
- **Process objects** cannot be direct children of Item (use QtObject or properties)
- **StdioCollector** only delivers complete data, not streaming
- **Socket connections** work for persistent streams but not multiple simultaneous queries

### QML Best Practices Applied
- **QtObject** for singleton services with Process children
- **Property-based** object declaration for proper scoping
- **Sequential processing** for Process-based operations
- **Proper error handling** with graceful degradation

## üéâ Celebration Note

**This represents a major achievement in Wayland desktop development!**

We successfully built a complete IPC integration for niri from scratch, overcoming significant technical challenges and creating a robust, real-time status bar system. The sequential processing breakthrough was particularly elegant - turning a complex concurrency problem into a simple queue solution.

**The Lumin bar is now ready to evolve into a world-class Wayland status bar system!** üöÄ
