  # This module is intended to be imported by Home Manager

  # Placeholder for future user-level TUI settings
  # Examples:
  # - Shell configurations
  # - Terminal application configs
  # - User-specific aliases and functions
  # - Personal development environment settings
  
  # For now, this ensures the structure is ready for Home Manager integration
