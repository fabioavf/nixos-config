  # This module is intended to be imported by Home Manager

  # Placeholder for future user-level GUI settings
  # Examples:
  # - Application-specific config files
  # - User-specific desktop entries
  # - Personal application settings
  # - User-level service configurations
  
  # For now, this ensures the structure is ready for Home Manager integration
